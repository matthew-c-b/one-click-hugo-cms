`[TRANSLATOR’S NOTE: Study Starter—Another expression, commonly used in English and some other languages is “Icebreaker.”]`

**Study Starter (5–10 min.)**The purpose of the Study Starter is to encourage everyone in the group to join in. The simple question helps each person to be open and willing to be involved in the Bible study.

**Opening Prayer (1 min.)** There are two prayers offered during a small group Bible study: (1) a brief opening prayer and (2) at the end of the session, a prayer for specific people, needs or circumstances.

`[TRANSLATOR’S NOTE: If you cannot translate this phrase: “Follow the ABC’s of prayer: (1) Audible, (2) Brief and (3) Christ-centred”, then substitute this sentence: “Follow the three principles of group prayer: (1) out loud, (2) brief and (3) Christ-centred”.]`

Some of the small group members may not know how to pray. The opening prayer should be simple so that any person could lead it at each meeting. Follow the ABC’s of prayer: (1) Audible, (2) Brief and (3) Christ-centred.

### Bible Study

**Bible Reading (5 min.)** After the opening prayer, choose someone to read the “About” section, which will help the group to understand the Bible readings for each lesson. These Bible verses were carefully selected. \[[Then look up the Bible verses and read them aloud in the group. Encourage listeners to follow along in their own Bibles if they have them, or several can look on together if only a few Bibles are available.]]{{Then read the Bible verses aloud in the group.}} We gather around the Word of God as a group to experience, know and commit ourselves to live by God’s Word.

**Study (20–30 min.)** This section is the most important part of the meeting and takes the most time. The leader should encourage everyone to join in the discussion. Take time for all participants to answer the questions privately to themselves after the Scripture reading. Then the leader may ask those in the group to read their responses aloud. The most important thing is to get involved with the Word of God, both by paying close attention to the Bible reading and by discussing the thought-provoking questions.

### Prayer

**Closing Prayer (5–10 min.)** This is a prayer for specific people, needs or circumstances. Everyone can join in this prayer. Here participants can bring personal needs or the needs of others before the group and before God. Praise God and thank him for how members of the group see God at work in their lives and in the world.

### Prepare for the Next Meeting

**Prepare for the Next Meeting (3–5 min.)** This activity is an invitation for personal growth. It encourages everyone to stay in touch with the Word of God outside of the weekly group meeting. In addition, it helps participants prepare for the next lesson. It includes other Bible chapters to read and suggestions on how to read them.
