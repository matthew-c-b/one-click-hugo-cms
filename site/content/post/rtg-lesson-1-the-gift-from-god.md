### About Ephesians

Paul (also called Saul) was a Jewish leader who had been persecuting followers of Jesus Christ. But one day Jesus himself, now raised from death, suddenly appeared to him! (Read the beginning of Paul’s story in Acts 9.) After Paul accepted Jesus as the Son of God and Lord of all people, he travelled around the Mediterranean world telling people about Jesus. Because of his teaching, new believers gathered to form many new churches.

As their spiritual guide, Paul wrote letters to teach and encourage these new churches. People who disagreed with Paul fought against his efforts to tell the world about Jesus. These enemies caused him a lot of trouble and suffering. In fact, Paul was in jail when he wrote this letter to the church at Ephesus. Probably other churches in that region also read the letter.

In this letter, Paul teaches that the Good News of God’s grace through faith in Jesus Christ is for everyone. It is both for Jews and for people who are not Jews (Gentiles). Paul applauds the non-Jewish followers of Jesus for their new life as members of God’s holy people. Whether Jew or Gentile, they are united in Jesus Christ. And their unity shows to the spiritual forces of darkness the wisdom of God’s plan. So Paul explains the way they live now should be different because they have a new life together in Christ. In this lesson, we will learn that this new life is God’s gift to everyone who believes in Jesus.

> <1> In the past you were spiritually dead because of your sins and the things you did against God. <2> Yes, in the past your lives were full of those sins. You lived the way the world lives, following the ruler of the evil powers that are above the earth. That same spirit is now working in those who refuse to obey God. <3> In the past we all lived like that, trying to please our sinful selves. We did all the things our bodies and minds wanted. Like everyone else in the world, we deserved to suffer God’s anger just because of the way we were.
>
> <4> But God is rich in mercy, and he loved us very much. <5> We were spiritually dead because of all we had done against him. But he gave us new life together with Christ. (You have been saved by God’s grace.) <6> Yes, God raised us from death to life with Christ Jesus and seated us together with Christ in the heavenly places. <7> God did this so that his kindness to us who belong to Christ Jesus would clearly show for all time to come the amazing richness of his grace.
>
> <8> I mean that God saved you by grace because you believed. You did not save yourselves; it was a gift from God. <9> You are not saved by the things you have done, so there is nothing to boast about. <10> God has made us what we are. In Christ Jesus, God made us new people so that we would spend our lives doing the good things he had already planned for us to do.

### Prayer

* Pray for anyone who would like to receive the gift of life in Jesus. Give thanks to God for their new life, and ask God to enable them to continue on the right path.
* Share with others how God has been kind to you. Give thanks to God for his grace and love.
* Ask for wisdom so that you will be able to understand God’s Word and put it into practice during the next week.
* Share with the group the needs and concerns of the people within the group, and pray for them.

### Prepare for the Next Meeting

For the next small group meeting, read the book of Ephesians. We suggest that you read one chapter per day. Answer these questions: (1) What does the chapter say about God? (2) What did I learn about myself and my life? Think about what you have learned. Talk to God about it, and tell him the needs you have.
