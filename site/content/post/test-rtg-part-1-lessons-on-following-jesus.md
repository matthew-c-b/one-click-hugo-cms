# Transforming Experiences

Reaching towards a goal takes great effort. This is very true; life is not easy, and we are not always sure that God is with us. Sometimes we will be confused and wonder if we are living the way God wants us to live. And there are times when we will question God’s care for us.

In _Reaching Towards the Goal_, we will learn about a famous follower of Jesus named Paul. After he believed in Jesus and was changed, he was very successful in telling others about Jesus’ love for all people. But sometimes other religious leaders saw his teaching as a threat. Paul was insulted, rejected, beaten and even put in prison. He understood that since Jesus had suffered, he would also suffer.

But Paul had something very personal that bothered him. We don’t know exactly what it was. Paul called it a painful problem (2 Corinthians 12:7), and it made him suffer.

He seemed to be doing everything that God wanted him to do. Paul questioned why he had this painful problem. Did he do something wrong? Should he blame God? Or Satan?

So Paul prayed that God would remove his painful problem. He begged God three times to remove it. [[(Look up 2 Corinthians 12:9 to find God’s answer.)]]{{And God answered, “My grace is all you need. Only when you are weak can everything be done completely by my power” (2 Corinthians 12:9).}}

Paul’s painful problem humbled him. It taught him that he should not think he was better than anyone else. And it taught him to rely only on God. \[[Paul said he was even glad for weaknesses if they brought him closer to Christ (2 Corinthians 12:10).]]{{Paul said, “Yes, I am glad to have weaknesses if they are for Christ” (2 Corinthians 12:10).}} When Paul was weak he had to rely on God, and God always helped him.

When we are weak, reaching towards a goal is difficult. When we are tired and discouraged, this can keep us from reaching the goal. God promises to give us his grace when we follow Jesus Christ, especially when we are weak or suffer.

God calls us to make a lifetime commitment. How do we keep going down the road when problems stand in our way? How does God’s gift of a new life in Jesus change us in practical ways? What are some principles to live by? This study answers these questions and more.
