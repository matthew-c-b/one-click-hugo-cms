# Introduction

Welcome to this Bible study written and published by Bible League International. _Reaching Towards the Goal_ will help you in your new relationship with Jesus. Here are some simple guidelines that will help you successfully lead or participate in this study. One of its best features is that anyone can use it. It is simple and easy to adapt to different situations. We pray that your journey through this Bible study will be a time of great delight and spiritual benefit.

# Small Group Studies

We encourage you to participate with others in Bible studies and to develop the new habit of reading and studying the Bible. _Reaching Towards the Goal_ is useful for small group and individual Bible study. But it is prepared with the interactive group Bible study in mind. The leader guides the small group but does not function as a traditional teacher. Rather, he or she keeps the group discussion moving forward so that each person in the group is able to participate.

Here are some suggestions for the Bible study group:

1. At the first meeting, the leader should clearly describe the purpose of the Bible study. Primarily, the group meets to study the Word of God in order to guide participants towards a better relationship with Jesus Christ. The group also meets for Christian fellowship, teaching the value of being a part of the church and learning how to pray with and for each other. The leader starts the meeting, keeps the study and discussion going and closes the study at the proper time.
2. The group leader should encourage everyone to take part in the discussion. The leader should keep his or her involvement to a minimum, allowing others to join in the discussion. Group meetings work best when more people have the opportunity to participate, and people remember what they learn when they can talk in the discussion.
3. The best size for the group is 3 to 10 participants. The meeting place can be a house, an office, a backyard, a school or any other place where a small group of people can gather. \[[Acts 5:42 tells how the apostles taught the people, both in the Temple and in the people’s homes.]]{{Acts 5:42 says, “The apostles did not stop teaching the people. They continued to tell the Good News—that Jesus is the Messiah. They did this every day in the Temple area and in people’s homes.”}}
4. Attend every meeting. In order to make the Word of God active in our lives, studying it should be very important. \[[Read Matthew 4:4.]]{{Matthew 4:4 says, “Bread is not enough. People need more than food to live. Their lives depend on whatever the Lord says.”}}
5. Respect others by being on time. \[[Philippians 2:4 instructs us not to be interested only in ourselves, but to care about other people as well.]]{{Philippians 2:4 says, “Don’t think about what is good for you but about what is good for others.”}} When we arrive late without a good reason, we make others feel bad and uncomfortable. People who often arrive late may cause the group to fail.



\s Introduction to the Bible

\p The word “Bible” comes from a Greek word meaning “books”. The Bible is actually two collections of books, often referred to as the “Old Testament” and the “New Testament”. The word translated “testament” means a covenant or agreement. It refers to God’s promise to bless his people. The Old Testament is the collection of writings that relate to the agreement God made with the descendants of Jacob (also called Israel). The New Testament is the collection of writings that relate to the new agreement God made with all people who believe in Jesus Christ.



\s How to study the Bible

\p Learning to study the Bible in a way that helps people understand and believe God’s Word is very important. By carefully reading a passage from the Bible, asking questions about what it describes, what it says is important and why it is important, we will be able to understand God’s Word and apply it to our lives. Let’s take a look.



\s1 What do I see in this passage?

\p The more careful your observation, the better you will understand the text. The better your understanding, the more helpful your application of the passage will be.

\p Look for answers to the following questions:

\b

\li Who? (main characters)

\li What? Which?

\li How? (means of action)

\li When and where?

\li For whom was it written?

\li Who wrote it?

\li Why was it written?

\li Words that point out purpose, results and consequences. Examples are “therefore, when, if, because, so that, however, but, and, though, even though”.



\s1 What does it say?

\p The Bible was written so that it could be understood. Some parts of the Bible may be more difficult for us to understand because they are new to us or because we have never heard about what we are reading. Studying the Bible helps us to ask these questions so that we can understand its message. Here are some guidelines:

\b

\li1 1. Think about: Does the text tell a story? Is it poetry? Is someone giving a speech or sermon? Is it a letter?

\li1 2. Are figures of speech used (examples are a parable, a proverb, comparing one thing to another, overstatement, moving words around for emphasis)? What message do they communicate?

\li1 3. Respond to: What did the author want to communicate? What topic is the author talking about? What does it teach me about God, Jesus, the Holy Spirit and human beings?

\li1 4. Evaluate: Is my understanding consistent with other parts of the Bible?



\s1 How do I apply it to my life?

\p The passage may give you an example to follow, a command to obey, a promise to trust, a challenge to accept, or a reason to praise God. It may also make you aware of a sin to confess.

\p When applying a passage to your life, focus on that passage before you consider another passage in your study. Here are some questions to help you apply the Bible passage to your life:

\b

\li1 1. How is God asking you to change your heart and mind? Are there new truths that you should believe?

\li1 2. How can today’s message change the way that you think and act?

\li1 3. How can you show God’s love for other people?



\s Presenting Reaching Towards the Goal

\p The paragraphs below may help you introduce \bk Reaching Towards the Goal\bk* to your Bible study group or others.

\p Part 1 of \bk Reaching Towards the Goal\bk* provides you with some basic tools to help you grow in your new life as a follower of Christ. It will help you to become spiritually mature in Christ.

\p Part 2 of \bk Reaching Towards the Goal\bk* focuses on the importance of living the new life guided by Christ within the community of faith, which is the church. It helps the participants continue to grow and learn about God and his Word. It will help each person in the group enjoy a life of obedience to God and to be a part of a church.



\s How long will it take to complete the Bible study?

\p It can take up to six months to complete the study material, depending on how often your group meets. Each session should last approximately one hour. We recommend using the small group schedule on the next page for each session. The suggested times will help the leader to keep the pace of the meeting moving forward. The actual times for each activity will depend on the needs of the group from week to week. At the end of Parts 1 and 2, you will have completed 20 exciting Bible lessons to help you reach towards the goal of becoming the person God wants you to be.

\p We also suggest that the small group take a one-week break between Part 1 and Part 2.

\periph INT - Introduction

\mt1 How to use Reaching Towards the Goal

\zrem \[TRANSLATOR’S NOTE: Study Starter—Another expression, commonly used in English and some other languages is “Icebreaker.”]

\p \bd Study Starter (5–10 min.)\bd* The purpose of the Study Starter is to encourage everyone in the group to join in. The simple question helps each person to be open and willing to be involved in the Bible study.

\p \bd Opening Prayer (1 min.)\bd* There are two prayers offered during a small group Bible study: (1)\~a brief opening prayer and (2)\~at the end of the session, a prayer for specific people, needs or circumstances.

\zrem \[TRANSLATOR’S NOTE: If you cannot translate this phrase: “Follow the ABC’s of prayer: (1) Audible, (2) Brief and (3) Christ-centred”, then substitute this sentence: “Follow the three principles of group prayer: (1) out loud, (2) brief and (3) Christ-centred”.]

\p Some of the small group members may not know how to pray. The opening prayer should be simple so that any person could lead it at each meeting. Follow the ABC’s of prayer: (1)\~Audible, (2)\~Brief and (3)~Christ-centred.



\msbk Bible Study

\p \bd Bible Reading (5 min.)\bd* After the opening prayer, choose someone to read the “About” section, which will help the group to understand the Bible readings for each lesson. These Bible verses were carefully selected. \[[Then look up the Bible verses and read them aloud in the group. Encourage listeners to follow along in their own Bibles if they have them, or several can look on together if only a few Bibles are available.]]{{Then read the Bible verses aloud in the group.}} We gather around the Word of God as a group to experience, know and commit ourselves to live by God’s Word.

\p \bd Study (20–30 min.)\bd* This section is the most important part of the meeting and takes the most time. The leader should encourage everyone to join in the discussion. Take time for all participants to answer the questions privately to themselves after the Scripture reading. Then the leader may ask those in the group to read their responses aloud. The most important thing is to get involved with the Word of God, both by paying close attention to the Bible reading and by discussing the thought-provoking questions.



\msbl Prayer

\p \bd Closing Prayer (5–10 min.)\bd* This is a prayer for specific people, needs or circumstances. Everyone can join in this prayer. Here participants can bring personal needs or the needs of others before the group and before God. Praise God and thank him for how members of the group see God at work in their lives and in the world.



\msar Prepare for the Next Meeting

\p \bd Prepare for the Next Meeting (3–5 min.)\bd* This activity is an invitation for personal growth. It encourages everyone to stay in touch with the Word of God outside of the weekly group meeting. In addition, it helps participants prepare for the next lesson. It includes other Bible chapters to read and suggestions on how to read them.
